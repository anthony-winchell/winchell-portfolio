                <h3><span>Dear hiring manager, </span> <br><br></h3>
                <p>
                    Regarding my application for the position of <strong>Web Developer</strong> at <em>Software Solutions Inc.</em>, 
                    I hope you will consider the technical skills I would bring to your team and the career worth of soft skills 
                    I gained from my time in the customer service industry. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many people in the technology industry lack the fundamental soft skills needed for any profession. The industry 
                    often overlooks the ability to communicate professionally with clients and coworkers due to the prioritization of technical skills. 
                    While those skills are critical, understanding people and communicating with them properly is vital for any business. Customers and users are 
                    likely uninterested in the technical aspects of the job or project and are only concerned with proper communication regarding the product and the final result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I spent a long time in a very different environment in the service industry, it's important to call on experience and draw similarities. In both industries 
                    and organizations, following procedures, regulations, and guidelines is vital to success and sometimes mandatory. The importance of being able to execute while being organized 
                    and following guidelines and regulations cannot be overstated.</p>
                <p>
                    I believe that not only do I possess the skills and knowledge to deliver quality work promptly since I am familiar and feel comfortable with the technologies used in this job title, 
                    but I could become a vital member of the team by being able to properly communicate with clients and ensure satisfaction at every stage of the software development life cycle.
                </p>
